# APCS-Projects
This is my code for APCS. **DO NOT COPY THIS CODE. THAT WOULD BE PLAGORISM. JUST LOOK AT IT AND ALL OF ITS GLORY**

All of this was coded in Eclipse.
## But why
Many people ask me later on, "How did you do this". Now, I can just send them a link to this. I will only upload projects once they are complete and have recieved a 100%.
## Disclaimer
I can not garentee that:
- The code works
- All of the files will be uploaded
- No one will try and look at your answers

#### However
As of the time these files are uploaded, all of them *should* be complete.

## **THE CODE I DOWNLOADED HAD AN ERROR**
Please just make an new issue, I will handle it as soon as possible


Good luck
